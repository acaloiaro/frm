# frm 

frm is an embeddable HTML form builder for Go.

**This is a work in progress and not production-ready**

## Usage

<TBD>

## Inspiration

This project is heavily inspired by [opnform](https://github.com/jhumanj/opnform). OpnForm is very good, and if you don't have an _embeddable in Go_ requirement, then you should consider OpnForm instead.
